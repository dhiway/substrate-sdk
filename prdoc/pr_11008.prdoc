    A followup from https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8541 with changes requested by @eskimor:
    - Adjust the protocol parameters and add comments about the picked values
    - Simpler fetch mechanism - advertisements from unknown collators (those with 0 reputation) are delayed. Everything else is fetched immediately.
