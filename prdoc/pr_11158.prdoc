title: 'Add timeout + people-westend to check-runtime CI'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    @polkadot-api/check-runtime hangs in case the RPC endpoint is not reachable. A timeout is added to handle this case gracefully.

    Driven-by: add support for metadata-hash extension on `people-westend`  and add it to the list of chains to check.
