title: '[eth-rpc]: cap block_number_to_hashes map size'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: When keep_latest_n_blocks (cache-size) is None, every processed block
    is inserted into the BTreeMap used for detecting reorgs, but never removed, except
    during reorgs. Since reorgs deeper than 256 blocks are unlikely, cap the map at
    256 to prevent unbounded growth.
